I see OSS as a quite hard thing to get started with. It's a step you take in your coding experience that takes you further and opens a lot of doors. After around two years in web development, I am launching my first open sourced project.

## Why?

- give back to the community (never did before)
- increase dev skills and OSS knowledge
- meet people, build something together and for fun!

I want to give back and help people. If I struggle with something, there is a chance that other people have the same problem.

## How?

- find a problem
- fix it for you
- build something "serious"
- publish, try yourself, document and launch!

Where I feel the most confortable in web development is the front-end part and especially Nuxt.js (a framework built on top of Vue.js).

I wanted something small to start.

## Introducing `<hyper-link>`

As I am mostly using Vue.js on my daily work, it is there that I'd be more likely to find situations where I'd be struggling.

`<hyper-link>` is a Vue.js helper.

## Thank you!
